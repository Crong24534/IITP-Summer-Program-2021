# Project8-IoT-Solar-Powered-Weather-Monitoring
IITP Summer Program 2021 Project 8

Micro-climatology has become an important tool for agriculture worldwide. There is a huge push to put as many weather monitoring stations as possible throughout the agricultural areas of the U.S. and most countries. Though many commercial units are available, building a unit consisting of sensors and communications systems is a valuable learning experience and covers almost all facets of IoT.
