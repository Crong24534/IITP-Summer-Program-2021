a. UAVâ€™s have started become intrusive to many areas of civilian life, often intruding or effecting criminal or terroristic behaviors. In this project, we will examine how to develop low cost acoustic nodes to detect and alert about incoming UAV.
b. A second area of this project is how to network these acoustic nodes together to create a defensive net around a physical space. This acts as a protective net around buildings, human gatherings or critical infrastructure, such as a nuclear power plant.
