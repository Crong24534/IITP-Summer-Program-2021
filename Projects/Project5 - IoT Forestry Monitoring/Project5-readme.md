Forestry is a critical industry in the U.S. and around the world. Monitoring the health of forests can be a huge challenge, as many are in remote locations and require specific radio networks to penetrate the foliage and pass data to towers that may be many miles away. This project will investigate methods to gather data from sensors in a tree farm using a combination of drones and LoRa communications.
