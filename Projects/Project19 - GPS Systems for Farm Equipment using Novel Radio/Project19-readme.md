Older farm equipment does not typically have any sensors or electronics. But there are many millions of old farm implements in use today. This project develops a way to create GPS systems for older equipment to connect to a base station and show where the equipment has been and what ground it has covered. Older equipment is normally simpler so this could lead to simplified autonomous applications in agriculture.
